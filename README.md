# Welcome to RealityChain: A Multichain Metaverse for Everyone

![RealityChain Metaverse](02.gif.gif)


Born from a realization that virtual digital spaces should be casual, accessible and user-friendly to reach mass adoption, RealityChain offers a new approach to the Metaverse. Starting from a 2D-first perspective, we've created spaces that can be experienced in parallel with real life.

Originally launched on NEAR, RealityChain is now a fully multichain Metaverse, running on both NEAR and Ethereum. Our platform hosts multiple metaverses, with myriad.town being the first launched. Soon, we will release additional metaverses including 2d.miami, paras.city, and uniqueone.world.

RealityChain integrates with popular video streaming services like Zoom, Twitch, and Youtube, enhancing the immersive and interactive experience. We also offer an Android app, which can be found at [realitychain.city](https://realitychain.city), and a Chrome extension at [realitychain.net](https://realitychain.net).

Future updates will include an open API for NPC control, enabling easy AI integrations to NPCs, and a survival adventure gamification layer to highlight the gameplay capabilities of the engine.
